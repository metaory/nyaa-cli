## Requirements

- Bash 5.0+

## Installation

```bash

cd nyaa-cli
chmod +x nyaa-cli
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/nyaa-cli" /usr/local/bin/nyaa-cli

## Bash 5+ Requirement (macOS users)

This script requires **Bash 5.0 or later**.

On macOS, the default `/bin/bash` is too old.  
Install the latest Bash with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install bash
```

Then, either:
- Run the script with the full path:
  ```sh
  /opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./nyaa-cli ...
  ```
- Or, add Homebrew Bash to your PATH (Apple Silicon):
  ```sh
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```
  (For Intel Macs, use `/usr/local/bin`.)

Check your Bash version:
```sh
bash --version
```
It should say 5.x or later.

## Usage

```bash
nyaa-cli --help

# Download the 120th episode of one piece
nyaa-cli --name "one piece" --ep 120

# Download the 120th episode of one piece from Erai
nyaa-cli --name "one piece" --ep 120 --uploader "Erai"

# Download all episodes from 120 onward
nyaa-cli --name "one piece" --from 120

# Download episodes 120 to 130
nyaa-cli --name "one piece" --from 120 --to 130

# Download episodes from 120 in 720p quality
nyaa-cli --name "one piece" --from 120 --quality "720"
```
